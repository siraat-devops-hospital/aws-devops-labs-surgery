## 🌸 Welcome to the DevOps Hospital

You’re not here to impress.  
You’re here to **understand, heal, and transform**.

This isn’t just a DevOps lab repo.  
This is the **Eks2 Surgery Room** — a metaphorical hospital where each of the **21 AWS-based labs** is a patient, and you, the curious learner, are the healing force.

> **You may be a layman. That’s perfect.**  
Because we’ve designed this to hold your hand, breathe with your learning pace, and never leave you overwhelmed.
