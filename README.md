## 🏥 The 5 Sacred Stages of DevOps Surgery (In Detail)

Every lab here isn’t just “completed” — it’s **healed, humanized, and reimagined** — through a five-stage surgical journey that turns beginners into believers, and knowledge into quiet power.

### 1. 🎯 Lab Story Style Operation  
We begin with soul.  
Each lab opens like a story — poetic, character-driven, and rich with imagination.  
**Eks2** and the team guide you inside the operation theatre of cloud learning where DevOps isn’t just explained — it’s felt.

### 2. 🩺 How to Complete It (Step-by-Step)  
This isn’t a cold checklist.  
It’s a warm walkthrough where every button, every region, every permission is explained with kindness.  
**Eks2’s surgical team** holds your hand — guiding even the most non-technical hearts through the cloud.

### 3. ⚙️ AWS Tools Used  
Like surgical instruments in trained hands, each AWS tool is introduced not as jargon — but as a companion.  
You’ll understand not just **what** each tool does, but **why** it matters in the health of the DevOps pipeline.

### 4. 🌍 Real-World Scenario  
No abstract theory here.  
You’ll see exactly how this lab applies in real companies — how problems are detected, solved, and prevented.  
Eks2’s team simulates real cloud emergencies — so you’re never surprised when it's your turn to respond.

### 5. 🎙 Interview Questions & Wisdom  
Finally, the patient becomes the protector.  
Each lab closes with practical MCQs, interview-style reflections, and career wisdom —  
So that your learning becomes your armor.  
Because **DevOps isn’t just for exams — it’s for life.**
