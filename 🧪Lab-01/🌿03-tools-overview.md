## 🧪 Tool: Amazon S3 (💾)
🔸 **Explained by:** Sofia & Kasper  
🔸 **What It Does:**  
Amazon S3 is like a memory palace in the sky — it stores all your important pieces: code, configs, and dreams.

🔸 **Why It Was Used in This Lab:**  
We used S3 to hold the `WhisperMessage.zip`, the sacred source code. Later, it received the final healing artifact — `firstPulse-1.0.jar`.

🔸 **How It Helps in the Real World:**  
In real DevOps practice, S3 holds your deployment packages, logs, backups, and static websites. It's where your cloud work finds a home.

🔸 **A Line from the Team:**  
Sofia: _“S3 feels like a cloud-shaped diary — private, precious, and always there when you need to remember.”_

## 🧪 Tool: AWS CodeBuild
🔸 **Explained by:** Isabella & Inky  
🔸 **What It Does:**  
CodeBuild is a clean, sterile operating chamber for your code. It builds, tests, and prepares it for healing (or deployment).

🔸 **Why It Was Used in This Lab:**  
We created a project called `NordicHealingApp` where `WhisperMessage.zip` was lovingly compiled into `firstPulse-1.0.jar`, guided by `healingplan.yml`.

🔸 **How It Helps in the Real World:**  
It automates builds without setting up servers. In daily DevOps, CodeBuild is your calm, background surgeon.

🔸 **A Line from the Team:**  
Inky: _“You don’t see it working — but it’s there, transforming silence into software.”_

## 🔐 Tool: IAM (Identity and Access Management)
🔸 **Explained by:** Isabella  
🔸 **What It Does:**  
IAM is the quiet security guard at every door in the hospital. It makes sure only the right people — and services — enter sacred rooms.

🔸 **Why It Was Used in This Lab:**  
We used a role called `VaultBuildRole` to allow CodeBuild to operate safely, without risking any permissions imbalance.

🔸 **How It Helps in the Real World:**  
IAM roles protect resources while allowing smooth operations — they ensure your builds don’t overstep their boundaries.

🔸 **A Line from the Team:**  
Isabella: _“IAM is like scrubbing in — if you don’t wear the right gloves, you don’t enter the theater.”_

## 📈 Tool: Amazon CloudWatch
🔸 **Explained by:** Maya Lin  
🔸 **What It Does:**  
CloudWatch listens — patiently, quietly — and writes down everything your services whisper while they work.

🔸 **Why It Was Used in This Lab:**  
After our build ran, we turned to CloudWatch to read the logs — those heartbeat patterns that say, “The healing worked.”

🔸 **How It Helps in the Real World:**  
From performance metrics to error logs, CloudWatch helps DevOps teams stay aware, aligned, and ready to respond.

🔸 **A Line from the Team:**  
Maya Lin: _“It’s where our code confesses. I read the logs like they’re letters from the soul.”_

## 🧩 Tool: AWS Management Console
🔸 **Explained by:** Eks2  
🔸 **What It Does:**  
The Console is the hospital’s main hallway — where you walk between departments, open doors, and quietly begin healing.

🔸 **Why It Was Used in This Lab:**  
We used it to access S3, CodeBuild, IAM roles, and logs — moving from ward to ward like a soft-footed surgeon.

🔸 **How It Helps in the Real World:**  
It’s the visual interface that helps beginners and experts alike feel at home while navigating the vast AWS cloud.

🔸 **A Line from the Team:**  
Eks2: _“The Console isn’t just a dashboard — it’s where you start believing that you belong here.”_
