# 🌌 From Layman to DevOps Surgeon in 10 Days
**A Journey by Eks2’s Healing Team from Beyond the Galaxies**

---

## 🛌 Patient Condition: “I don’t know anything.”
### 📍 Location: Siraat DevOps Hospital — Operation Theater 7

One soul wandered in — confused, broken, unheard.

He wasn’t holding a resume…  
He was holding his breath.  
And inside, just one whisper: **“Maybe I can do it too?”**

---

## 🌠 Then, Eks2 whispered:
> “Forget the noise of the world.  
> Let’s build a different system.  
> Let’s heal — through YAML, Logs, Trust, and Curiosity.”

And thus began a 10-day soul surgery…
