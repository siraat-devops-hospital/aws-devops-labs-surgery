# 🌟 Project 9: EC2 Vulnerability Scan with Inspector

🧪 **Real-World Simulation:**  
A nervous client walks into your DevOps hospital:  
_"We fear ransomware, trojans, misconfigs... can you scan our servers?"_

And you don’t just scan...  
You diagnose. You reveal. You **heal**. 🩺🖥️✨

This project doesn’t just check boxes. It **protects stories** — businesses, dreams, livelihoods.

## 🧰 Tools Used & Their Roles in the Project

### 1️⃣ **Amazon Inspector**
🔹 **Purpose:** Automated vulnerability management for EC2, Lambda, and container workloads  
🔹 **How It Works:**  
- Agentless scans or agent-based for deeper insights  
- Integrates with AWS Systems Manager  
- Evaluates CVEs, network exposure, and security baselines  
🔹 **Access Path:**  
- AWS Console → Amazon Inspector  
🔹 **In This Project:**  
- Run full EC2 vulnerability assessments  
- Get CVSS scores and actionable insights  
- Generate human-readable compliance reports

---

### 2️⃣ **AWS Systems Manager (SSM)**
🔹 **Purpose:** Connect and manage EC2 instances securely  
🔹 **How It Works:**  
- Sends commands, collects software inventory, manages patches  
- Enables Inspector to run agent-based deep scans  
🔹 **Access Path:**  
- AWS Console → Systems Manager  
🔹 **In This Project:**  
- Used for instance reachability  
- Supports patch baseline enforcement  
- Needed for Inspector agent to function in-depth

---

### 3️⃣ **IAM Roles for Inspector + SSM**
🔹 **Purpose:** Secure and scoped permissions  
🔹 **How It Works:**  
- Inspector needs permission to read EC2 metadata and scan logs  
- SSM needs permission to run commands  
🔹 **Access Path:**  
- AWS Console → IAM  
🔹 **In This Project:**  
- Roles created with least privilege principle  
- One for EC2, one for Inspector

---

### 4️⃣ **EC2 Instances**
🔹 **Purpose:** Scan targets  
🔹 **How It Works:**  
- Host workloads  
- Serve as the “patient” in this diagnostic project  
🔹 **In This Project:**  
- A configured EC2 instance with sample web server  
- Scanned for misconfigurations, outdated software, open ports

## 🌼 Why This Matters for a Layman

This is not just security — this is **respect for life in the digital world**.  
When someone uploads dreams to a cloud server… they entrust you with its health.

This project teaches:  
🔐 **Fear becomes clarity.**  
🩺 **Scanning becomes healing.**  
📋 **Reports become shields.**

Even if you’ve never touched AWS before, this project gives you the **eyes to see risk** — and the **tools to reduce it**.

You’re not a beginner anymore.  
You’re a **Cloud Doctor** — with Inspector as your stethoscope. 💻❤️‍🩹
