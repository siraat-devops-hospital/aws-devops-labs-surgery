# 🌟 Project 7: AWS Config + GuardDuty Setup

🚨 **Real-World Simulation:**  
A compliance officer walks into the room: “Where’s the audit trail?”  
Security team peers over their glasses: “Can you alert us before the breach?”  
And you — you smile, and say: “I already did.” 😌🔐✨

This project builds **invisible armor** around the infrastructure —  
where **audits run themselves**, and **threats reveal themselves** before they even knock.  
Welcome to automated governance.

## 🧰 Tools Used & Their Roles in the Project

### 1️⃣ **AWS Config**
🔹 **Purpose:** Continuous resource compliance monitoring  
🔹 **How It Works:**  
- Scans all AWS resources against a set of rules  
- Records configuration changes and stores in timeline  
- Sends alerts if non-compliance is found  
🔹 **Access Path:**  
- AWS Console → Config  
🔹 **In This Project:**  
- Set managed rules (e.g., “S3 buckets must not be public”)  
- Track resource drifts over time  
- Enable config recorder + delivery channel

---

### 2️⃣ **Amazon GuardDuty**
🔹 **Purpose:** Intelligent threat detection and insights  
🔹 **How It Works:**  
- Analyzes VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail events, DNS logs  
- Detects patterns like port scanning, unusual logins, malware traffic  
- Sends detailed findings with severity tags  
🔹 **Access Path:**  
- AWS Console → GuardDuty  
🔹 **In This Project:**  
- Enable GuardDuty  
- Integrate with existing AWS logs  
- Review findings dashboard

---

### 3️⃣ **AWS CloudTrail**
🔹 **Purpose:** Provides the event history of your AWS account  
🔹 **How It Works:**  
- Tracks every API call made in the environment  
- Used by Config + GuardDuty as backend log source  
🔹 **Access Path:**  
- AWS Console → CloudTrail  
🔹 **In This Project:**  
- Ensure trail is active and S3 bucket is storing logs  
- Validate integration with both Config and GuardDuty

---

### 4️⃣ **Amazon SNS**
🔹 **Purpose:** Notify teams on audit violations or threat detections  
🔹 **How It Works:**  
- Config or GuardDuty ➝ SNS ➝ Email or Lambda  
🔹 **Access Path:**  
- AWS Console → SNS  
🔹 **In This Project:**  
- Create SNS Topic  
- Subscribe Security Officer email  
- Connect GuardDuty or Config triggers

---

### 5️⃣ **IAM Roles and Permissions**
🔹 **Purpose:** Grant least privilege access to these services  
🔹 **How It Works:**  
- Config needs access to describe resources  
- GuardDuty needs log read access  
🔹 **Access Path:**  
- IAM Console → Roles  
🔹 **In This Project:**  
- Attach AWSConfigRole and GuardDutyServiceRole

## 🌌 Why This Matters for a Layman

This is not just security — this is **cloud self-awareness**.

It’s the difference between:
🚶 “I’ll check later…” vs. 🚨 “I already know.”

You become the **silent protector** of your infra.  
The one who **knows first**, who **warns right**,  
and whose system never says “I didn’t see it coming.” 🌙🛡️

This project turns you into a **Security Sage** —  
an invisible force behind visible protection.
