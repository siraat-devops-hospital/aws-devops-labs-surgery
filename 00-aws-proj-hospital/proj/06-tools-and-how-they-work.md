# 🌟 Project 6: CloudWatch Logs + Alarms for EC2 and Lambda

🔍 **Real-World Emergency:**  
A worried client says, “We never know when things break.”  
Your job? Make their infrastructure speak — not with panic, but with precision. 📣💡

In this project, you're not just building alerts — you're gifting **peace of mind** to teams that live in the dark without them.

## 🧰 Tools Used & Their Roles in the Project

### 1️⃣ **Amazon CloudWatch Logs**
🔹 **Purpose:** Collect logs from EC2, Lambda, and other AWS services  
🔹 **How It Works:**  
- EC2 logs via CloudWatch Agent  
- Lambda logs automatically  
- Logs stored in groups for querying, alerting  
🔹 **Access Path:**  
- AWS Console → CloudWatch → Log Groups  
🔹 **In This Project:**  
- Collect logs from your deployed apps  
- Enable CloudWatch Agent on EC2  
- Ensure Lambda functions output structured logs

---

### 2️⃣ **Amazon CloudWatch Alarms**
🔹 **Purpose:** Notify you when something goes wrong  
🔹 **How It Works:**  
- Based on metrics (CPU > 80%, Lambda error > 2%)  
- Triggers SNS alerts or dashboards  
🔹 **Access Path:**  
- AWS Console → CloudWatch → Alarms  
🔹 **In This Project:**  
- Set alarms for EC2 CPU, Lambda errors, memory use  
- Choose thresholds and attach actions

---

### 3️⃣ **Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)**
🔹 **Purpose:** Send notifications via Email/SMS when alarm triggers  
🔹 **How It Works:**  
- Alarm → SNS Topic → Email or Lambda or SMS  
- Decoupled + scalable communication  
🔹 **Access Path:**  
- AWS Console → SNS → Create topic  
🔹 **In This Project:**  
- Create an SNS topic  
- Subscribe an email  
- Connect CloudWatch alarm to SNS

---

### 4️⃣ **CloudWatch Dashboards (Optional)**
🔹 **Purpose:** Visualize system health in real-time  
🔹 **How It Works:**  
- Graphs, logs, and metric widgets in one place  
- Easy to present to clients or team leads  
🔹 **Access Path:**  
- AWS Console → CloudWatch → Dashboards  
🔹 **In This Project:**  
- Add dashboard for Lambda + EC2 health metrics  
- Present daily health updates visually

---

### 5️⃣ **IAM (Permissions)**
🔹 **Purpose:** Allow EC2 and Lambda to publish logs to CloudWatch  
🔹 **How It Works:**  
- Attach IAM roles with logging policies  
🔹 **Access Path:**  
- IAM Console → Roles → EC2InstanceRole / LambdaExecutionRole  
🔹 **In This Project:**  
- Ensure EC2 has CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy  
- Ensure Lambda has CloudWatchLogsFullAccess (least privilege recommended)

## 🌼 Why This Matters for a Layman

Without logs, you're **blind**.  
Without alarms, you're **deaf**.  
But with both — you **see, hear, and respond** in real time. 🧠🔔

This project trains your senses as a DevOps surgeon —  
to listen to the heartbeat of servers,  
feel the stress in functions,  
and respond before clients even notice pain. 💖🩺🌈

You're not just a technician anymore.  
You’re a **Cloud Listener.**  
An **Infrastructure Whisperer.**
