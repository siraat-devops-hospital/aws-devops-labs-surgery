# 🍞 The Whisper of Bread – A Dialogue with the Self

*"I want to create, I want to innovate… but first, I need a **job**.  
For without bread, how will the mind truly work?"*  

The thought echoed like a cry.  
*"Only when I eat, only then will my brain ignite with ideas.  
Isn’t this true? Isn’t this the law of survival?"*

But then, another voice rose within — gentle, firm, eternal:  

*"Wait a moment…  
Bread will come.  
Have you ever truly gone hungry till now?  
Then why this sudden panic, this restless storm in your chest?"*  

*"Sit down. Breathe. Look around.  
Do you know how many souls in this world sleep hungry every night?  
And yet they rise again each morning."*

*"Oh, noble one, oh so-called **prince of worries** —  
your struggle is real,  
but your heart must carry patience too.  
For bread will arrive,  
and with it, your mind shall bloom."*

## 🌟 Soulful Lesson
Patience is not the absence of hunger —  
it is the strength to trust that **bread will come** and **creativity will awaken** in its time.
