# ðŸŒ³ The Conversation of Two Trees

One tree looked at the other and sighed:

*"Oh my dear friend, we grew together since we were smallâ€¦
And look at you now â€” standing tall, side by side with me.
Our little children are still so tinyâ€¦ barely reaching our roots."*

The treeâ€™s voice trembled as it continued:

*"Do you ever feel that we are truly giving something to the world?
Look today â€” the sun is burning, its fire pressing down on me.
And beneath my shade, humans rest so happily, smiling in comfortâ€¦
But they donâ€™t see the pain I feel in bearing this heat."*

It paused, almost in tears:

*"Why donâ€™t you give me courage? Why do I feel so alone in this burden?
How foolish I am â€” of course you suffer the same,
but unlike me, you do not complain."*

The other tree whispered softly through its leaves:

*"Yes, my dearâ€¦ I bear the same pain.
But a mother does not cry when she takes hardship,
because she knows her child is resting in peace beneath her."*

And in that moment, the first tree understood:
ðŸŒ¿ **To give is to endure. To endure is to love.**

*"Pain becomes light when you realize it shelters someone elseâ€™s joy."*
