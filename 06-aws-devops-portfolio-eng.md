# 🚀 AWS DevOps Projects Portfolio  

This portfolio is divided into two parts:  
1. 🌟 **Core Showcase Projects** → Three flagship projects that create immediate impact for interviews and clients.  
2. 📑 **Detailed Projects (18 Labs)** → Hands-on labs that cover AWS DevOps certification prep and practical freelancing.  

---

## 🌟 Core Showcase Projects (3 Pillars of DevOps)  

1. **Dockerize + ECR/ECS Deployment**  
   - Containerize an app, push image to ECR, and deploy via ECS (Fargate)  
   - Full solution with Application Load Balancer + CloudWatch Logs  

2. **Serverless Workflow (Step Functions)**  
   - Chain three Lambda functions (Upload → Process → Notify)  
   - Orchestrated using a Step Functions State Machine  

3. **CI/CD with CodePipeline**  
   - Source control → Build (CodeBuild) → Deploy (CodeDeploy)  
   - Fully automated pipeline with rollback and alarms
