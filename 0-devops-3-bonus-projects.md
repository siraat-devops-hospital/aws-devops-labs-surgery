## 🚀 Bonus Project 1: Dockerize + ECR/ECS Deployment

**Goal:** Package an application in Docker, push image to AWS ECR, and deploy it via ECS (Fargate).  

### 🔧 AWS Services
- **ECR** → Store Docker images  
- **ECS (Fargate)** → Run containers serverlessly  
- **ALB (Application Load Balancer)** → Route incoming traffic  
- **CloudWatch Logs** → Monitor container logs  

### 📝 Steps
1. Write a `Dockerfile` for a sample app (Flask/Node.js).  
2. Build & tag the image locally.  
3. Push the image to **Amazon ECR**.  
4. Create an **ECS Cluster** with Fargate launch type.  
5. Define **Task Definition** using the ECR image.  
6. Create an **ECS Service** with desired count (e.g., 2).  
7. Attach **Application Load Balancer** to distribute traffic.  
8. Test app via ALB DNS endpoint.  

### ✅ Deliverables
- `Dockerfile` + app code  
- ECR push script (`push.sh`)  
- ECS Task Definition JSON  
- GitHub repo + README  
- YouTube demo: *“From Dockerfile to AWS ECS in 15 Minutes”*

## 🌌 Bonus Project 2: Serverless Workflow with Step Functions

**Goal:** Build a serverless workflow that chains multiple Lambda functions via Step Functions.  

### 🔧 AWS Services
- **Step Functions** → Workflow orchestration  
- **Lambda** → Business logic functions  
- **S3/DynamoDB** → Store inputs/outputs  
- **CloudWatch** → Logs & metrics  

### 📝 Steps
1. Write 3 Lambda functions:  
   - Function A → Upload handler (stores file in S3).  
   - Function B → Processing (e.g., resize image, parse JSON).  
   - Function C → Notify user (via SES/SNS).  
2. Create a **Step Functions State Machine** with sequence: A → B → C.  
3. Connect Step Functions with IAM permissions to call all Lambdas.  
4. Upload sample file → trigger workflow → verify outputs.  
5. Monitor execution graph in Step Functions console.  

### ✅ Deliverables
- Lambda code (Python/Node.js)  
- State Machine JSON definition  
- GitHub repo + README  
- YouTube demo: *“Serverless Workflow in Action: AWS Step Functions”*

## 🌠 Bonus Project 3: CI/CD with CodePipeline

**Goal:** Fully automate app build, test, and deployment using AWS CI/CD services.  

### 🔧 AWS Services
- **CodeCommit/GitHub** → Source repo  
- **CodeBuild** → Build & test stage  
- **CodeDeploy** → Deploy app to EC2/ECS  
- **CodePipeline** → Orchestrator  

### 📝 Steps
1. Create repo (CodeCommit or connect GitHub).  
2. Write a `buildspec.yml` for CodeBuild (install deps, run tests, package app).  
3. Configure CodeDeploy deployment group (target EC2 or ECS service).  
4. Define **CodePipeline** stages:  
   - Source → Build → Deploy  
5. Push code → watch pipeline auto-trigger → deployed to target.  
6. Add CloudWatch alarms for failed deployments.  

### ✅ Deliverables
- `buildspec.yml` + sample app  
- CodeDeploy config (`appspec.yml`)  
- Pipeline JSON template (CloudFormation)  
- GitHub repo + README  
- YouTube demo: *“CI/CD with CodePipeline: Zero-Touch Deployment”*

## ✨ Why These Projects Matter
- **Real-world relevance** → Clients and companies need these setups every single day.  
- **Depth + Breadth** → You cover containers, serverless, and CI/CD — the 3 pillars of modern DevOps.  
- **Galactic Edge** → Showcasing these proves you can design, automate, and secure infra at scale.
